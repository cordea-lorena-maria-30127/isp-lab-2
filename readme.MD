# Starting from the template, implement the following exercises:

1) Write a program that ask you to read a random number of numbers(between 2 and 10) from keyboard. Then display the arithmetic mean of the numbers

2) Given the Liga 1 ranking. Write a program which ask the user to enter a number of points. If the number match the exact number of points of a team then display the team name.
If the user do not enter an exact number of points the show this message:"No team from Liga 1 have $numberOfPointsEnteredByUser$ points"

3) Write a program which display the geometric mean of the primes number from [a,b] where a,b->[1,200] a<b, a and b are read from keyboard.
Also display the number of prime numbers which have the sum of digits an even number.

4) Given an vector of N integer elements. Display the first prime/odd/even number from the vector and their respective position

5) Generate a vector of size 20 with random elements from [-1000,1000].
	display the vector.
	sort the vector using bubbleSort/quickSort/mergeSort/anySortMethodButNotOneAlreadyImplemented
	display the sorted vector

6) Generate fibonacci vector/ some random vector which multiply the precedent 2 values from the vector
	a) non-recursively
	b) recursively

7) Giving the the vector ucl[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,13] meaning the times a team wins the UCL trophy
generate aRandom -> [0,7] ask user "How many teams win the UCL trophy ucl[aRandom] times"
(the matching values are [10,4,2,1,2,1,1,1] according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Cup_and_UEFA_Champions_League_finals)
and the logic similar with the one from last year.
